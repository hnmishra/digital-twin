# MLOps: Serverless AI/GenAI Conversational Platform

## Overview

Architected and deployed a production-grade serverless AI conversational platform combining modern MLOps practices with cloud-native infrastructure. The system integrates large language models (LLMs) with persistent memory management and automated CI/CD pipelines, enabling enterprise-ready AI-powered interactions at scale.

## Technical Architecture & Implementation

### 🔹 AI Model Integration & Optimization

- Integrated Amazon Bedrock with multi-model selection capability (Amazon Nova Micro, Lite, Pro) for cost-performance optimization
- Implemented intelligent model selection based on latency and cost requirements
- Built context-aware prompt management system for consistent LLM interactions

### 🔹 Serverless Backend (FastAPI + AWS Lambda)

- Developed high-performance REST API using FastAPI with async request handling
- Deployed on AWS Lambda using Mangum ASGI adapter for serverless execution (millisecond cold starts)
- Configured CORS middleware for secure frontend-backend communication
- Implemented robust error handling and request validation using Pydantic models

### 🔹 Stateful Conversation Management

- Engineered S3-backed conversation memory system for persistent user context across sessions
- Built JSON-based memory snapshots with UUID tracking for multi-turn conversations
- Implemented secure access controls with S3 bucket policies and ownership enforcement

### 🔹 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) & Deployment Automation

- Created comprehensive Terraform configurations for AWS infrastructure (Lambda, S3, CloudFront, API Gateway)
- Automated resource provisioning with environment-based tagging and configuration management
- Developed PowerShell/Bash deployment scripts for CI/CD pipeline integration
- Implemented infrastructure state management and disaster recovery procedures

### 🔹 Full-Stack Development

- Built modern React/Next.js TypeScript frontend with Tailwind CSS for responsive UI
- Configured environment-based deployments with AWS S3 + CloudFront CDN integration
- Implemented client-side form validation and real-time conversation streaming
